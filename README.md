I. ABSTRACT
Aim: This project is to design a circuit that input 4 numbers, sort and display them when the appropriate buttons are used.
Language Used: Verilog
IDE: Xilinx
Design: The project is designed in 3 parts. In the input part, the numbers were imported as per the selection of Part A and Part B and stored as per Part C. In the sorting part, the numbers were compare two at a time and put into registers to sort them in ascending order. If number 1 was greater than number 2, number 1 was put into register B1 and number 2 was put into register S1. The same was followed for numbers 3 and 4 using registers B2 and S2. Then the registers B1 and B2 were compared to each other followed by S1 and S2. The final sorting output was put into the sorted number register. The sorting part is done only when Part D is started. Part E displays the sorted elements.
